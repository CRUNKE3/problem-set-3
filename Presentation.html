<h1>Presentation</h1>
<p>Presentation is important to food when you are trying to make the product look appetizing or photogenic. Restaurants usually try to make <br/>
  their dishes have a good presentation on their menus in order to attract customers to buy that certain dish or dishes. Not only do restaurants <br/>
  use presentation to their advantage, but so do bakeries. While there may be different intentions between the two, each of them rely on this aspect<br/>
  to attract their customers and make them buy it.</p>
<h2>Restaurants</h2>
  <p>As said before, restaurants try to perfect their presentation in order to persuade customers. However, they also try to consistently make their<br/>
    meals have a good presentation in order to get good ratings on yelp and have a good reputation.</p>

  <h2>Bakeries</h2>
  <p>Just like Restaurants, Bakeries want to have a good prepartation in order to sell the item. While this may be true, most bakers take the time<br/>
  to put a lot of effort and havea good presentation for pride. Bakeries aren't as rushed as Restaurants, so they are able to take the necessary <br/>
  time to put in a lot of effort to make their cakes or pastries look nice and presentable.</p>
