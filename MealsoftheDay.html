<h1>Meals of the Day</h1>

<h2>Breakfast</h2>
  <p>Breakfast is the first meal of the day, giving you the energy you need to either go to work or head to school. <br/>
  This is one of the most important meals due to how essential it is to stay awake and energized.<br/>
  Breakfast should normally be consumed around 7:00 am because it is the best time to get the required energy and <br/>
  make it to Lunch time.</p>
  <p>While eating breakfast is essential, some people struggle to make time for this meal because they either wake up too late <br/>
    or they running late for work or school. Some quick and easy breakfast meals include:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Cereal</li>
    <li>Oatmeal/Porridge</li>
    <li>Yogurt</li>
    <li>Granola Bar</li>
    <li>Toast</li>
  </ol>

<h2>Lunch</h2>
  <p>The second meal of the day is Lunch. Lunch is commonly confused with people whether it is important or not. <br/>
  Well, Lunch is important, just like Breakfast and Dinner, because of energy. Running on low energy for any device or human <br/>
  outputs low quality products. Lunch should be consumed at about 12:45 or noon. This is because the energy that was obtained <br/>
  at breakfast should be running out and more is required. Eating lunch will help whomever get through the day until Dinner comes around.</p>
  <p>Some optional lunches that could appeal to anyone include:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Sandwich</li>
    <li>Salad</li>
    <li>Wrap</li>
    <li>Soup</li>
    <li>Leftover Dinner from last night</li>
  </ol>
