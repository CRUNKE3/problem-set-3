  and jelly, there are much more complex ways that require more steps and a lot more effort.</p>
  <br/>
  <h2>Cooking</h2>
  <p>Cooking is one of the most common ways to prepare a meal. You just get the necessary food items, mix them together, and put them in a pot or pan <br/>
  to heat them up to a point of making the flavors blend and taste good.</p>
  <p>Cooking also has more complex ways of being done. These styles include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Thai</li>
      <li>French</li>
      <li>Indian</li>
      <li>And Many More</li>
    </ul>
<p>All of these different cuisines have the same goal to produce some food that is tastey and good to eat. They also all use spices to bring out flavors in <br/>
  famous meals.
